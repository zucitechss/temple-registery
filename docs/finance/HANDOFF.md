## Task Status

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| FIN-021 — Kollur source system | **COMPLETE** |
| FIN-022 — Kollur capabilities | **COMPLETE** |
| FIN-023 — Revenue source of truth | **COMPLETE** |
| FIN-024 — Mapping rules | **COMPLETE** |

Verified against a real MySQL database, not against the migration file. 27 tests.

## Current State

**What works.** The finance foundation (FIN-010…015), the registry / sync-worker runtime
boundary (FIN-016), the generic connector contract (FIN-030), and now the complete Kollur
configuration (FIN-021…024).

The platform can now say, for one real temple, what it can and cannot report, which source
field is authoritative for revenue, and how that source's vocabulary translates into
canonical terms — without holding a credential, knowing an endpoint, or being able to reach
anything.

**What does not work yet.** No connector implementation, no extraction, no canonical fact
table, no API. The dashboard is still the static HTML file. No row of temple financial data
has been read and no credential exists anywhere.

---

## Migration Files

`backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V111__kollur_finance_configuration.sql`

Configuration data only. Creates no table, alters no schema, enables no synchronization,
stores no credential, no host, no port, no URL and no connection string.

**Every statement is conditional on temple 300001 existing** (FIN-D-014). No migration in
this repository creates that temple — `V100` seeds temples with ids `100`… — so an
unconditional seed would have left a source system, 19 capability rows, a source-of-truth
declaration and 9 mapping rules orphaned in every fresh developer and CI database.

> **Operational consequence that must not be forgotten.** A versioned migration runs once.
> In an environment where temple 300001 is created *after* V111 has run, the seed never
> applies and Kollur configuration must be applied through the onboarding path (FIN-140) or
> by re-running the statements manually. V111 is idempotent, so re-running is safe.

## Seeded Rows

| Table | Rows |
|---|---:|
| `fin_source_system` | 1 |
| `fin_temple_capability` | 19 |
| `fin_source_of_truth_decl` | 1 |
| `fin_mapping_rule` | 9 |

### Source system (FIN-021)

`temple_id=300001` · `system_code=KOLSOHAM` · `source_temple_code=43` ·
`source_database_name=KOLSOHAM_LOCAL` (documentation only) · `credential_ref=kollur-readonly`
(an **alias**) · `sync_enabled=0` · `sync_schedule_cron=NULL`.

`connector_type` is **`PULL_JDBC` and provisional**, recorded as such in the row's own
`notes` (FIN-D-016). Q4 is unresolved and the column is `NOT NULL`, so a value had to be
written; it reflects how the source was analysed, not a finding that the platform can reach
it. If Q4 resolves to `PUSH_AGENT`, that is one `UPDATE` and nothing else changes — which is
what the FIN-030 contract exists to guarantee.

### Capabilities (FIN-022) — 19, every value of the canonical vocabulary

| Availability | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| `AVAILABLE` (10) | `REVENUE`, `SEVA`, `DONATION`, `PRASADAM_SALE`, `CANCELLATION`, `PRECIOUS_METAL_COUNT`, `PRECIOUS_METAL_WEIGHT`, `IN_KIND_DONATION`, `NIRANTARA_SUBSCRIPTION`, `NIRANTARA_SCHEDULE` |
| `PARTIALLY_AVAILABLE` (2) | `NIRANTARA_PAYMENT`, `PAYMENT_MODE` |
| `NOT_AVAILABLE` (7) | `PRECIOUS_METAL_VALUE`, `NIRANTARA_EXECUTION`, `EXPENSE`, `EXPENSE_CATEGORY`, `GRANT`, `GRANT_UTILISATION`, `WORKS` |

**The brief listed 18; the canonical vocabulary has 19.** The missing one was
`IN_KIND_DONATION`, and Kollur genuinely has it — donated sarees recorded with a donor-stated
value, 182,675 records from FY2016-17. Seeded `AVAILABLE`, with the reason recording that
the value is **donor-declared, not appraised**, and that it **must not be summed with auction
proceeds for the same articles** — the auction realises the value of the identical sarees, so
adding both counts them twice.

Coverage windows: revenue `2019-04-01 → 2026-07-26`; precious metals
`2015-04-01 → 2026-07-25` with FY2021-22 and FY2022-23 recorded as gaps; Nirantara payments
`2017-04-01 → 2024-03-31`; Nirantara schedule `2019-05-01 → **2027**-07-26`. Capabilities
with no reliable coverage — `NIRANTARA_SUBSCRIPTION` and all seven unavailable ones — carry
no dates rather than invented ones.

The reasons are user-facing copy, and the distinctions they preserve are the point:

- **Expenditure** — "the source system does not record expenditure … it is not zero."
- **Payment mode** — "no digital payment was recorded … **not** that the payment was made in
  cash." A receipt where the operator left the card field blank cannot be distinguished from
  a genuine cash sale.
- **Metal value** — weight is measured and reported; a monetary value "cannot be derived
  without an assumed rate, which would be an invention rather than a measurement."
- **Nirantara execution** — the preparation flag "is also set on schedules dated into 2027 —
  so it means that a schedule was generated, **not that a seva took place**."

### Source of truth (FIN-023)

`REVENUE_AMOUNT` v1 → `DailySevaNew.Amount`, effective from `2019-04-01`, `effective_to`
NULL (in force).

Filter: `Deleteflag = 0 AND TempleCode = 43 AND ReceiptDate >= '2015-01-01' AND
BillCancled = 0` for recognised revenue. The declaration also records that extraction
*retains* cancelled rows so cancelled counts and amounts can be reported separately — net is
gross minus cancelled. That resolves an apparent contradiction between ADR-008 and the
extraction sketch in `FINANCE_DATA_INTEGRATION.md`: they operate at different levels, and
the declaration now says so explicitly rather than leaving it latent.

All three measured alternatives are recorded with their evidence:

| Rejected | Measured | Why |
|---|---:|---|
| `DailySevaNewOld` | 16,982,270 rows | Byte-exact duplicate of all six archives; including it doubles every historical year |
| `DailySevaNewDetails.TotalAmount` | ₹53,77,53,226 | 41 % below the header total, with 1:1 row correspondence and zero orphans — internal inconsistency, not missing records |
| `DailySevaNewDetails.Amount × Qty` | ₹56,31,07,228 | Disagrees with the header *and* with the detail table's own column |

The rationale also carries the two correctness rules that are easiest to get wrong later:
the **rate-card price is a list price and is never revenue**, and **receipt counts are
receipts, not devotees**.

### Mapping rules (FIN-024) — 9

`SANNIDHI:DS → SEVA` · `SANNIDHI:SS → SPECIAL_SEVA` · `SANNIDHI:KN → DONATION` ·
`SANNIDHI:PS → PRASADAM_SALE` · `SEVA_CODE:430 → HUNDI_DONATION` ·
`STREAM:SAREE_DONATION → IN_KIND_DONATION` · `STREAM:SAREE_AUCTION → ASSET_REALISATION` ·
`METAL_TYPE 2 → GOLD` · `METAL_TYPE 1 → SILVER`

Source values are namespaced and **the more specific rule wins** (FIN-D-015). Without the
`SEVA_CODE:430` override, donation-box collections — 13 records averaging over a crore each —
would be reported as ordinary donations and would dominate any ranking of services devotees
purchased.

No `PAYMENT_MODE` rules are seeded: for this source, payment mode is inferred from the
*absence* of card details, which is connector logic rather than a value mapping.

No canonical value was invented; all nine come from the taxonomy already in
`FINANCE_DATA_MODEL.md`, and a test enforces that.

## Tests

**Added:** `backend/src/test/java/com/templeregistry/migration/KollurFinanceConfigurationMigrationTest.java`
— 27 tests.

It drives Flyway directly against a MySQL 8.0 Testcontainer and reads the seeded rows back
over JDBC, deliberately **not** loading the Spring context: every full-context test in this
project is red for two pre-existing reasons unrelated to finance (FIN-X-001, FIN-X-002), and
configuration that could only be verified after someone else fixed those would not be
verified at all. The side benefit is that it exercises the migration exactly as it will run
in production.

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `mvn -o test -Dtest=KollurFinanceConfigurationMigrationTest` | **27/27 pass** |
| `mvn -o test -Dtest='*Finance*,*SyncWorker*,*RegistryRuntime*,*SourceCredential*,*Connector*,*Kollur*'` | **103/103 pass** |
| `mvn -o test` (full suite) | **958 run · 0 failures · 18 errors** |

What is asserted, beyond row counts: the conditional guard (zero rows *before* the temple is
created), `sync_enabled = 0`, that **every persisted value** in `fin_source_system` contains
no endpoint or credential pattern, that the table has no credential column at all, that each
of the 19 reasons is substantive rather than filler, that unavailable capabilities are not
expressed as zero, the coverage windows and gaps, all three rejected alternatives with their
measured figures, that no mapping value contains SQL or a source table name, and idempotency
by re-applying the whole seed.

---

## Failures

**New: none.** Pre-existing: **18**, unchanged in count, cause and location across the entire
branch (866 → 888 → 898 → 931 → 958 tests, always the same 18 errors in the same 4 report
files).

- **FIN-X-001** — `Schema-validation: missing column [field_names_json] in table
  [declaration_clarifications]`. Mapped by the entity, created by no migration, present in
  running environments only because `ddl-auto: update` adds it. Architecture risk **R7**,
  observed. Fix is one additive `ALTER`, owned by the declaration module.
- **FIN-X-002** — the `test` profile cannot boot a full context: the test JWT public key is a
  placeholder that fails to parse, and `application.yml` carries a TiDB-only
  `connection-init-sql` that H2 rejects.

---

## Architectural Decisions

- **FIN-D-014** — the seed is conditional on temple 300001 existing. Rejected seeding
  unconditionally (orphan configuration in every fresh database) and creating the temple in
  the migration (the finance platform does not own temple records).
- **FIN-D-015** — mapping source values are namespaced and the more specific rule wins.
  Rejected a rule per service code (164 rows the source already classifies for us) and a new
  `MappingType` value (vocabulary change to solve a naming problem).
- **FIN-D-016** — `connector_type` seeded provisionally rather than made nullable. Rejected
  weakening the column for every temple to express uncertainty about one, and rejected an
  `UNDECIDED` enum value that would add permanent vocabulary for a temporary state.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **The seed is a no-op where temple 300001 does not yet exist** (FIN-D-014). This is
   correct behaviour, but it means the live database is the only place the configuration
   actually lands today, and only if the temple predates the migration. Onboarding
   (FIN-140) is the durable answer.
2. **`connector_type` is provisional** pending Q4.
3. **`connector_bean = kollurFinanceConnector` names a bean that does not exist.** Harmless
   while `sync_enabled = 0` and nothing resolves it; FIN-031 is what will resolve it, and it
   must fail loudly rather than silently if a named connector is absent.
4. **No source-of-truth declaration for `PRECIOUS_METAL_WEIGHT`.** Deliberately out of FIN-023
   scope, but it is the natural defence against the discarded "assume 15 g and ₹12,000 per
   item" approach returning. One row whenever wanted.
5. **Capability rows carry `last_reviewed_at` set at migration time and no reviewer.** The
   reasons are user-facing copy about a government temple's finances and would benefit from a
   named business sign-off before the dashboard renders them.

---

## Q4 Status

**UNRESOLVED, and not resolved by assumption.** The seed stores `PULL_JDBC` only because the
column is `NOT NULL`, and says so in its own notes. Nothing in the configuration presumes the
platform can reach Kollur: there is no endpoint, no host, no URL, and synchronization is
disabled. `ConnectorType` still treats all four mechanisms as equals, and `SourceCredentials`
carries an *optional* principal so a push agent's shared key fits the same shape as a
database user.

If the answer is `PUSH_AGENT`: one `UPDATE` to `connector_type`, and a different connector
implementation. The canonical model, aggregation, APIs and dashboard are untouched.

## Q5 Status

**UNRESOLVED, and no credential was introduced.** `credential_ref = 'kollur-readonly'` is an
alias. No credential exists in Git, YAML, SQL, the migration, the tests, or
`fin_source_system` — and a test scans **every persisted value** in that table for endpoint
and credential patterns, so a future edit that smuggles one into a notes field fails the
build.

Choosing the permanent store still changes one `@Bean` method in `SyncWorkerConfig`.

---

## How To Continue

1. Read this file, then `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`.
2. `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` on `feature/db-integration`.
3. Confirm the baseline:
   `cd backend && mvn -o test -Dtest='*Finance*,*SyncWorker*,*RegistryRuntime*,*SourceCredential*,*Connector*,*Kollur*'`
   — expect **103 passing, 0 failures**. (Requires Docker for the migration test.)
4. Implement FIN-031 only. Do not implement a connector.
5. Anything that can reach a source system is registered in `SyncWorkerConfig` as a `@Bean`,
   never as a `@Component` — `FinanceIntegrationBoundaryTest` fails the build otherwise.
6. Run the suite, update the four tracking documents, commit as `FIN-031 ...`.

Do not repeat the architectural analysis. It is complete and in `docs/finance/`.

---

## NEXT ACTION

Implement **FIN-031**: a connector registry that resolves
`fin_source_system.connector_bean` to a `TempleFinanceConnector` instance within the
sync-worker runtime.

It must **fail loudly when a named connector is absent** — Kollur's row already names
`kollurFinanceConnector`, which does not exist yet, and a registry that returned null or a
no-op connector for a missing name would let a temple appear configured while silently
producing nothing. Register it in `SyncWorkerConfig` as a `@Bean`, and add a registry-side
check that a source system's declared `connector_type` matches the resolved connector's
`ConnectorMetadata.connectorType()`.
